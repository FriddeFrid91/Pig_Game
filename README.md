# Pig - Dice Game in Python
Pig is a simple dice game where the goal is to be the first player to reach 100 points. This project was developed by Merjam Al-Beibani, Sara Schmerti, and Frida JÃ³hannesson as a student project.

## Gameplay
Pig offers the option to play with another player or against the computer. When playing against the computer, you can choose the difficulty level.

## Rules
Each player takes turns rolling a single die.
Points accumulate based on the outcome of the dice rolls.
After every roll, the player has a choice: they can either save the total points they have gathered and pass the die to the other player, or they can roll the die again.
If a player rolls a 1, they lose all accumulated points from the current round.
