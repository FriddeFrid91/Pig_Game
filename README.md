# Pig - Dice Game in Python üê∑
A student project by Merjam Farj-Beibani, Sara Shmerti and Frida J√≥hannesson.
Pig is a simple dice game where the goal is to be the first player to reach 100 points. The game is played with one dice and involves strategic decision-making and risk-taking.

## Gameplay
Pig offers the option to play with another player or against the computer. When playing against the computer, you can choose the difficulty level.

## Rules üé≤
- Each player takes turns rolling a single die.
- Points accumulate based on the outcome of the dice rolls.
- After every roll, the player has a choice: they can either save the total points they have gathered and pass the die to the other player, or they can roll the die again.
- If a player rolls a 1, they lose all accumulated points from the current round.

- Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/FriddeFrid91/Pig_Game.git
